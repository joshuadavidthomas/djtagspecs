## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Support for resolving TagSpec manifests distributed inside Python packages via `pkg://` URIs.

### Changed

- Discovery guidance now prioritises tool-selected manifests and treats packaged catalogs as part of the default lookup flow, relaxing the requirement for root-level `djtagspecs.toml` files.

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- Catalog loader utilities with CLI commands for validation and flattening TagSpec documents.

### Changed

- The `version` field in TagSpec documents is now optional; when omitted, loaders default to the packageâ€™s current release.

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Initial publication of the TagSpecs specification and reference JSON Schema.
- `djts` CLI for generating the schema from the Pydantic models.
- Pydantic models that codify the TagSpecs data model for validation and tooling.
